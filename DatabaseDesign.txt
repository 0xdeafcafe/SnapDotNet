-- How it Works

	- Every User gets updated every 1 minute
	- If the user has gone 7 days without a single push being served, that is bumped up to every 6 hours.
	- If the user has gone 1 month without a single push being served, that is bumped to every 24 hours.
	- We can stop a user being pushed to and being updated by flagging them as being on probation
	- After an update, the user's 'NextUpdate' is set to 1 minute from the current time
	- Checking for new friends happens every 5 minutes and that is in a seperate scheduled job, ignores the 
		NextUpdate check, aswell as the LastPushedServed check. But holds the ability to skip users on Probation
	- All timers are controlled from the azure panel, meaning we can slow the checks down if the load is too heavy for x period of time.
	- Dolla Dolla Bills Ya'll

	- This will need a scale testing - super important, people pay for this
